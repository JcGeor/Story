Ding DOng went the door bell
as the door fell 
adding sore swells
to the floor well
only time will tell 
If I were to find
another way to grind
out a passion of mine
to ease my mind
or set me blind
of the insecurities
and impurities
that hit me so
hurtfully 
and yet I can see 
but I ain't free
from my worst enemy

Me
myself and I
a man that sees you cry
and sees through those lying eyes
the one that I most despise 
and the only way to kill em
is if I were to die.
